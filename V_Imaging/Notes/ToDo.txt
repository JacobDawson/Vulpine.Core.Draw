  the renderor class. The idea being that you can do all the color math in liniar space for better blending and
  interpolation, and then at the end convert back to logrythmic space for better storage. We can test this idea out 
  by adding a gamma text box to the resampeling page on the test program.

- I want to implement the XYZ, XYY, LAB, and LUV color spaces from the CIE, and keep the two that fit the best. I
  also should implement unit tests to make shure that all the color spaces can convert from RGB and back again.
  I can also make animations of the new spaces like I did for YUV.

- Consider implementing Contrast, saturation, and Temperature.

- I want to make a palleted image structor, to do that I need a pallet structor, and for the pallet structor
  I need the more generic KD-Tree.

- To do the former, I need to determin if the Math library should be dependent on the Data Structor library,
  or vice versa.
